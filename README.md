# typescript notes


## description

In the same spirit as [my react notes](https://github.com/jessicarush/react-notes), I'll be using this repo to collect my notes and examples as I learn TypeScript. Filenames reflect the topic as much as possible. The data directory contains resources for some of the examples. My training is self-guided through the use of the docs, text books and online resources listed below.


## credits

Some examples and notes come from the following:

- [TypeScript Documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/)
- [TypeScript 5 for developers](https://www.udemy.com/course/typescript-full-stack-programming/) - *Alex Horea*
- [TypeScript Deep Dive](https://basarat.gitbook.io/typescript/) - *Basarat Ali Syed*
